GotE-CanSat Software Repository!
===========

This will be the main place where the GotE CanSat Team will place our software. Using Github allows us to make things
easier for us when we collaborate and make code.

A few notes:

* Please document all your changes thoroughly but not too much. This is so that when the FSW team actually integrates the code into the main code base, we will spend less time on trying to understand your code/changes and more time on actual coding and testing.
* For tutorials: http://lifehacker.com/5983680/how-the-heck-do-i-use-github is a good one as well
* Let one of us know if you have any questions.
